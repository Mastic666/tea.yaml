Fortune
=======

This plugin provides two commands, ``fortune`` and ``ofortune``, both of which
basically call the `fortune command <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)>`_
and post the result in the channel. In addition, ``ofortune`` supplies the
``-o`` option to ``fortune`` so that only offensive fortunes are chosen.
